The paper introduces a novel approach to constrain the filter coefficients by placing them on an arbitrary manifold. To better understand this concept, imagine representing the filter coefficients as points on a sphere in the provided image. In this specific case, the filter consists of three coefficients, and each point on the sphere corresponds to a particular combination of these coefficients.

By employing this manifold constraint, the authors argue that they are offering a more generalized framework compared to other types of constraints commonly found in the literature. Traditionally, constraints such as box constraints or linear constraints have been used to restrict the filter coefficients. However, the proposed method expands upon these conventional approaches by allowing the filter coefficients to reside on a manifold, providing greater flexibility and potentially capturing more complex relationships between the coefficients.

In essence, by adopting this manifold constraint, the paper offers a broader perspective on constraining filter coefficients, which could potentially lead to improved adaptive filtering techniques with enhanced performance and adaptability to various applications.
